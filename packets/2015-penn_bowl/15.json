This quantity is equal to quantity E over 2G all minus one, and like E and G, it can be measured using the impulse excitation technique. Materials like Gore-Tex, paper, and graphene have negative values for this quantity and are called auxetic. This parameter governs an effect in which compression along one (*) axis causes stretching along the other two axes.  For a stable, isotropic, linearly elastic material, this value varies between negative one and positive one-half, because the bulk, shear, and Young's modulus all have to be positive. For 10 points, name this material quantity equal to the negative transverse strain over the axial strain. ",
