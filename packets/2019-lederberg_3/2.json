A procedure named for this scientist uses a Fourier (\u201cFOR-ee-ay\u201d) transform to calculate a long-range term in (*) reciprocal space; that procedure is used to calculate the Madelung (\u201cMAD-uh-lung\u201d) constant and interaction energies in periodic systems and is his namesake summation. Maxima occur where a construct named for this man intersects the reciprocal lattice; that construct has radius two pi over lambda, and all points on it satisfy the Bragg condition. For 10 points, name this German scientist whose namesake \u201csphere\u201d is used to relate wave vectors and diffraction angles in crystallography.", "answer_sanitized": "Peter Paul Ewald [accept Ewald sphere or Ewald summation or Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald]", "subcategory": "Chemistry", "category": "Science"}, {"question_sanitized": "A theorem due partly to Coleman shows that any theory without Yang-Mills fields will necessarily lack this property. The degree of the special unitary group multiplies \u201cnegative eleven over six\u201d and is added to \u201cn sub f over three\u201d in a function whose sign determines whether a theory possesses this property. This property is equivalent to stating that the origin is an ultraviolet-stable fixed point. The sum of screening and anti-screening, known as the (*) beta function, is negative for theories with it. The Kondo effect is a classic example of this phenomenon because below the Kondo temperature the electrons strongly couple to impurities. This property was derived to explain Bjorken scaling in deep inelastic scattering. For ten points, name this phenomenon where a coupling constant decreases as the length scale decreases, which along with confinement is predicted by quantum chromodynamics.", "answer_sanitized": "asymptotic freedom ", "subcategory": "Physics", "category": "Science"}, {"question_sanitized": "The efficiency of these things can be predicted using a tubing performance curve. So-called \u201cstanding column\u201d examples of these things are created to make grouted loops, which provide the main mechanism of a D\u00b7H\u00b7E exchanger. The diameter of these things is typically measured at the sandface. Because H\u00b7D\u00b7R reservoirs typically take an ellipsoid shape, two of these things are used to access them near the reservoir\u2019s elongated ends. In a technique used to exploit E\u00b7G\u00b7S systems, water is placed in \u201cinjection\u201d examples of these sites to create a (*) temperature or pressure differential. The dumping of wastewater into these sites is a major cause of induced seismicity. A blowout preventer is placed atop these sites during exploration because the pressure of the formation below is unknown.
