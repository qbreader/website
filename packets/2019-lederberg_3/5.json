These sequences are often smoothed by subtracting seasonal means from them. For one of these sequences with N elements, a simple moving average can be calculated by summing elements \u201cx-sub-t\u201d through \u201cx-sub-t-minus-N-plus-one\u201d and dividing by N.

Crandall and Evans showed that this equation can be solved by the \"vanishing viscosity\" technique. If one function in these equations is independent of u and convex, then the Hopf-Lax formula can give explicit solutions. An extension of this equation including a value function provides necessary and sufficient condition for solving optimal (*) control problems; that extension is named for Bellman. This equation, which calculates the derivative of a principal function S with respect to generalized coordinates, solves all the equations of motion for position and momentum.

If all subsequences of a sequence of real-valued functions are convergent, than the sequence is both bounded and has a stronger form of this property by the (*) Arzela-Ascoli theorem. A function between topological spaces has this property if the preimages of closed sets are closed. A function f has this property if the limit of f of x as x approaches a is equal to f of a.
