The tetrahedral intermediate formed in the chymotrypsin mechanism is stabilized by these phenomena in the oxyanion hole. In solution, carboxylic acid dimers occur because of these phenomena. The Grotthuss mechanism involves diffusion through a network of them. Polar solvents that do not exhibit these phenomena, like DMF and DMSO, are favorable for SN2 reactions. Molecules that exhibit them, such as ethanol, have extremely broad peaks to the left of 3000 wavenumbers on an IR diagram.
