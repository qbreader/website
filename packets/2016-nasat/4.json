If a functor exhibits this property when restricted to morphisms with common domains and ranges, then the functor is faithful.

A function f exhibits this property if f-of-a equals f-of-b implies that a equals b. Restricting the domain of f-of-x equals x-squared to all positive numbers forces this condition upon f.
