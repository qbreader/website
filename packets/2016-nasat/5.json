Like the macrocyclic effect, this process can be considered as a result of a higher degree of ligand (LIG-ind) set preorganization. This process requires ligands that can have a denticity of two or greater. A manifestation of this process is the displacement of ammonia by ligands such as TMEDA and ethylene diamine.
